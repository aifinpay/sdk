"""Coinbase x402 flavor — `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` / `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` headers.

Reference: github.com/coinbase/x402

Detection works today. Payment execution is stubbed because the EVM /
SVM signing path requires a chain-specific wallet that the current Agent
doesn't carry yet (it has only an Ed25519 / Solana key). Wiring an EVM
key plus EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` flow is scheduled for a
later SDK minor (see `14 - Design - Generic x402 Client.md` in vault).
